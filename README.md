    ## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The frontend has an automated CI/CD pipeline set up for continuous integration and continuous deployment. Here's how it works:

- **GitHub Actions:** Our CI pipeline is managed using GitHub Actions, a powerful automation platform. Every time changes are pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions automatically triggers a series of predefined workflows.

- **Testing:** During the CI process, automated tests are executed to ensure that the code meets quality and functionality standards. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

- **Code Analysis:** We use static code analysis tools to check for code style and potential issues, ensuring high code quality.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

After successful CI, the CD part of the pipeline takes over:

- **AWS IAM Service:** AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is utilized to securely manage access to AWS resources during the deployment process. It ensures that the deployment process is both secure and efficient.

- **Deployment to AWS S3 and CloudFront:** The frontend is hosted on AWS S3, a scalable object storage service, and content is distributed using AWS CloudFront for low-latency access. Deployment is automated, meaning that any approved changes are automatically deployed to our production environment.
